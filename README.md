# Lam-Estimate
An android app to estimate lamination charges rapidly and make the work day more entertaining.
It was built to compensate for my lack of on-the-fly mathematical prowess with memes and a 
reasonable estimate.

This is the first android app I've made, so much of it is a learning process for me.

# Installing

I don't have a developer account with Google yet, so the only way to get the app is via the manual way: downloading the apk 
file in this repository, locating it using the files app by Google, and installing.

1. Download apk file [here](https://github.com/Adri6336/Lam-Estimate/blob/main/Lam%20Estimate.apk)

2. Locate the file using the Files app on your Android device (probably in the downloads folder).

3. Press on the file. A notice will pop up asking you to allow Files to install unknown apps. Do so.

4. Go back to file in the Files app and press it again. It will ask you if you want to install, 
press "install".


# Getting an Estimate

The estimate is limited to orders that deal with multiple pages of the same dimensions. 
To get an estimate you need to fill in values for a few different required settings: paper side width, 
num per line, and page count. To increase the quality of the estimate, you'll also be able to change
a few optional settings.

As this app doubles as a joke app, you should leave your device on mute if you want to use it while working.

## Required settings

These settings are required in order to get an estimate. They also can lead to auditory easter eggs.

**Paper Side Width**: this is the width of the sheet of paper as measured in inches. In the following image, the
side width is the highlighted portion of the paper.

**Num Per Line**: This represents the amount of sheets of paper that you can fit onto your 
feed table and laminate together.

**Page Count**: This represents the total amount of sheets of paper that you will need to laminate.

## Optional settings

These are the settings that have a predefined value. This value may be changed to make the estimation 
more accurate for your purposes.

**Space Between Pages**: This represents the average amount of space left between lines/rows of papers as measured in inches. 
The default value is based off of an average for me whenever I count four seconds down to two seconds between lines/rows of
lamination. This is probably the setting that will lead to the most inaccuracy; you should collect an average for yourself
to make the estimate better.

**Rate**: This is the amount of money per foot that will be charged for the lamination. Default setting
is 75 cents / ft.

**Min Charge**: This is the floor charge. If a lamination is super small, this is the lowest the charge is allowed
to be. Default setting is $1.25
